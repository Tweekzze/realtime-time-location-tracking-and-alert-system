# University of Engineering and Management National Park - Wildlife Tracker

## Overview

This project is a real-time wildlife tracking and monitoring system for University of Engineering and Management National Park. It utilizes WebSocket technology to provide real-time updates, displaying the location of visitors and simulated wildlife on an interactive map. The system provides safety alerts when visitors get too close to dangerous animals.

- üî¥ **HIGH THREAT**: Large predators and dangerous animals
- üü° **MEDIUM THREAT**: Potentially aggressive animals
- üü¢ **LOW/NO THREAT**: Harmless wildlife for observation

## üöÄ **Deployment on Render**

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub account with your code repository
- A Render account (free tier available)

### Step-by-step Deployment

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure:
     - **Name:** `uem-wildlife-tracker` (or your preferred name)
     - **Environment:** `Node`
     - **Build Command:** `npm install`
     - **Start Command:** `node server.js`
     - **Plan:** `Free`

3. **Environment Variables (if needed):**
   - No additional environment variables required for basic deployment

4. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Add your custom domain in Render dashboard
   - Update DNS settings as instructed

### Important Deployment Notes
- **WebSockets Support:** Render fully supports WebSockets needed for Socket.io
- **Auto Sleep:** Free tier will sleep after inactivity; first request after sleep may be slow
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automatically redeploys when you push changes to your repository
- **Logs:** Monitor application logs from the Render dashboard for troubleshooting
- **Scaling:** Easily upgrade to paid plans if you need more resources

## Local Development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
